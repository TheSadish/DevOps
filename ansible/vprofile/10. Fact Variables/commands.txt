Fact variables in Ansible are used to collect information about remote hosts. 
You can access facts using the `ansible_facts` variable. 

To display all facts, use the `setup` module:

ansible all -m setup

You can reference a specific fact in a playbook like this:
{{ ansible_facts['default_ipv4']['address'] }}
or using .
