Playbook variables have higher priority compared to group_vars/all

Priority:

from CLI - override the variable's value
Playbook variable
host_vars
group_vars/webservers
group_vars/all -> Most common



To run via CLI use option -e (only for testing rarely for anything else)
Eg:
ansible-playbook -e User_name=from_CLI -e Comment=comfromCLI variable_precedence.yml

We can also define variable in a list

- regions:
    - apwest
    - useast
    - northeast

To call it

regio: "{{ regions[0] }}"

Dictionary kind

region:
    us: west
    ap: east

call it

region: region.us


One more way we can define variable is an external file and call it inside playbook
This will also be considered as in-playbook variable and will have same precedence

vars_files:
    - /var/files/external_vars.yml
