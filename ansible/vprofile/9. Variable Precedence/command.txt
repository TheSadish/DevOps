Playbook variables have higher priority compared to group_vars/all

Priority:

from CLI - override the variable's value
Playbook variable
host_vars
group_vars/webservers
group_vars/all -> Most common



To run via CLI use option -e (only for testing rarely for anything else)
Eg:
ansible-playbook -e User_name=from_CLI -e Comment=comfromCLI variable_precedence.yml
